Hi Neil (and Anna and Tim).  Thanks for sharing this.  I have a few thoughts,
most of which are summarized in some back and forth with reviewers and editors
regarding our JMR paper.  I attach that here, as it seems relevant to the
issues you discuss.  Unsurprisingly, I found their objections entirely
uncompelling (though, of course, I agree that some of our stimuli can be
improved upon).



As I see it, the decoy must satisfy two properties:



(1) greater similarity to the target than the competitor (this seems
uncontroversial in all examples, despite some protestations to the contrary)

(2) inferiority to the target.  Though it is true that in creation of the
stimuli our assignation was based on common sense (or “assumption”), and
presumably was not as we intended for all participants, the choice data
themselves (see our Table 2) support our putatively “arbitrary” assignations,
as the option we label the decoy was, in fact, much less popular than (i.e.,
inferior to) the target.  So I don’t think this issue (or others) is really as
problematic or complicated as you (or our set of reviewers) make it out to be.
Bottom line, I liked your study, but I think you are giving our detractors too
much credit.  ; )



Best regards, Shane.
