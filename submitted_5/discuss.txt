what you suggested is what we did 
we thank the reviewer, this is exactly what weve done
we have now made this clear that we dropped

ran it on the whole sample the results are the same

weird columns, add confidence intervals

to chi square test as well

they only switched between A nd B on 8.5% (x pairs in total)
10 pairs where they switched incongruent, congruent



to account for for..... changed it a bit


#################################################### 
we havent seen people switch but this does not mean that they have a strong preference
could just mean consistemcy
it is really hard to tell these things apart 

AB A' BA B' also applies to AB A'
this critcism applies to all attraction effect designs
not just our paper


####################################################


Table A .1
just intercept and rating diff
 wide cis - there could be a huge attraction effect there

m 3 - int + 

m3 + in pref dummy

m both

and model x with all so currently 4 


then it is even less liekly that it would generalise to realistic options

#################################


change original to pre-registered


we don'T need to pass a a judgement on thsi, but literature 

we are teh first to use naturalistic stimuli whilst addressing


we have done these both

we ahve clarified the language throughout to make it clear , we are also 
now including between subjects first trial
