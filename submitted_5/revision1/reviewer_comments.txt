Reviewer 1 (Huber):
1) check if results are the same if we don't exclude people who chose the decoy (it is possible that people who do not choose the decoy would experience a similarity effect, limiting the attraction effect) 
just add it to main text
2) run the analysis on the first of each of the choice pairs
3) run the analysis on all those who switched across the two trials and check the proportion of those who switched towards the attraction effect aganst those who did not
throw out A and A and B and B
within a person and then t-test across 
all pc who switched pt-t-c pair

exlude no swicthes
calculate the prop of switches and do a t test on 0.5
average within pt and pt level t-test - CI

4) asking for analysis that "accounts for within person association" -- thought we have done that?
github revised the text to make clear we accounted
raw data and analysis can be found on git

Reviewer 2 ():
1) only take people who change their minds - AB preference must be weak, actually the genius of r1 addresses r3
2) put in spektor et al, cataldo - alignability - hard to spot
just put it in intro, most naturalistic 
3) plot td rating difference against probability of choosing the target
4) bin and plot as well - wasnt in the pre-reg 

Reviewer 3
- change kool-aid
- remove claim remove flawed
- thank you for tolerating the position of the paper we toned the language down see pages etcetc and hope it is more appropriate 
- delete they chose movies pairs.... -- just highlight that we created bespoke triplets
avoid describing how he did his
- add a high level summary
400 movis
worked out similarity 
selected target decoy pairsif they were similar
....

- attributes spatial separated
- nice sentences opening sentences
- replace further work with this is just one really carefully set up experiment that meets all of the criticisms and we cant find an ae
others perhaps less carefully but there's lots of them
this incicates robust under specific cond but not under general conditions indicating theorizing about how people choose and real world 
importance
- awaits further empirical work

---------------------------------------------------------------------
- last point is about AB or BA (same as Huber)


key thing that has changed are the extra tests - two new statistical test rev 1 and rev3 
and rev 2



the paper has been greatly improved 
we addressed major comments
we have also made changes 
detailed point by point
